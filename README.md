# XamBooksApp
I'm writing this app for book readers, in order to get track reading progress on our book. Obviously this app will be built using Xamarin.Forms.

### This is a Work In Progress, right now...

I've built the **GradientProgressBar** by now using Skiasharp, that was fun so I'm sharing this blog post about the process and simple math calcs about it.
